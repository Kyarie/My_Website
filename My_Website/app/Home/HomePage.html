<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

<p>
    My name is XueYing Hu, but I’m mostly known as Dora. 
    I’m a computer science student at the University of Waterloo and this is my website. 
    I coded it from scratch and it uses Bootstrap and AngularJS.
</p>
<p>
    If you are an employer, you are especially welcomed and please take a look at my resume! 
    I would love to discuss my qualifications at an interview. Please give me an interview and 
    I guarantee that you will be impressed!
</p>
<p>
    If you are not an employer, feel free to snoop around and contact me to get in touch. 
    I’m always up for meeting new people and sharing knowledge and ideas.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for visiting my website and hope you have a wonderful day!
