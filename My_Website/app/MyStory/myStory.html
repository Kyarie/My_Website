<h2>My Story</h2>

    <img src="../../Resources/Images/profile_picture.png" align="right" style="width:40%; padding:10px"/>
    I have chosen a very unique life path. While I studied computer science in Waterloo, I was doing political science research on the side. 
    I was hitting the big tech internships in Silicon Valley and Microsoft, but also published 3 papers in political science with the support of my advisor Dr. Hongying Wang.
    My life was at a crossroad between continuing in tech or doing a Ph.D in political science after I graduated from Waterloo. 
    With the rapidly changing domestic and international political landscape through the rise of populism and US-China competition, I decided that I wanted to try to make a difference with evidence-based research.
