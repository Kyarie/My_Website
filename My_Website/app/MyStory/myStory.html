<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>
    I am currently in my second at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. My first encounter with programming started in the summer before high school, when I wrote my first programs in JavaScript. Having always exceled at math and logical thinking, I was quickly captured by the “magic” of coding. It was very exciting to see simple lines of code produce results on screen. The more I learned about computers, the more I see how it transformed the present and how it will transform the future. Therefore I chose a career in computer science, to be part of the change that will sweep the world off its feet time and time again.

    However, computer is only part of my story. In 2006, a movie was released that changed my life forever. “Happy Feet” ignited my passion for the environment. I overcame my introverted personality and eagerly got involved in the promotion of sustainability. Through my volunteering experience in environmental organizations and research on environmental issues, my quest for solutions developed my strong interest in political science and economics. In University, I eagerly sought opportunities to conduct research in this field. I am also actively involved in University of Waterloo’s Model G20 Secretariat as a committee director to pursue my interests.
